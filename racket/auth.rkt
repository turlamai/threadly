;; M2 first slice — Discourse user API key sign-in (read scope), family
;; pattern: the app generates an RSA keypair, opens the forum's
;; /user-api-key/new authorization page, and the user approves. The forum
;; hands back an RSA-encrypted payload (a base64 blob to paste into the
;; hands back an RSA-encrypted payload (a base64 blob to paste into the
;; app) containing {"key": "<user api key>", "nonce": "<echoed>"}; the app
;; decrypts it with its private key, verifies the nonce, and stores the
;; user API key (0600). All signed requests then carry
;; User-Api-Key: <key>.
;; Scopes requested: read|write|notifications (M2). Keys issued before the
;; scope upgrade are read-only; posting re-raises the sign-in flow.
;;
;; Crypto goes through OpenSSL 3 by shelling out — the same family pattern
;; as update.rkt's signature verification — so the engine keeps zero
;; package dependencies beyond base. The private key exists only for the
;; handshake and is deleted as soon as the key is stored; the API key file
;; is written with 0600 and never logged.
