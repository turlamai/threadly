;; Threadly backend — the single RVT1 surface shared by the native hosts.
;; Everything declared here is the wire contract: changing an RPC name, an
;; Event, a State, or a row layout is a cross-platform release, not a local
;; edit.
;;
;; Rows are positional strings (Fulcrum style).
;;
;;   latest row     = (id title category-id posts-count reply-count
;;                     views like-count last-posted-at)
;;   topic-post row = (author avatar-url cooked-html created-at post-number)
;;   search row     = (id title created-at posts-count)
;;   category row   = (id name slug color)
;;
;; Errors never crash an RPC: the handler emits `notify` with the message
;; and returns empty rows; the host decides how to surface it.
;;
;; Lifecycle: the embedded runtime calls `start` with the two RVT1 fds.
