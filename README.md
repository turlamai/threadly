# Threadly

A native client for the Racket community forum — browse, read, and
search [racket.discourse.group](https://racket.discourse.group) without
opening a browser tab. The forum is where Racket's design decisions,
proposals, and ecosystem news actually happen; Threadly gives those long
technical threads the reading experience they deserve, on the desktop
on macOS, Windows and Linux. Mobile is deferred.

## Why

Every page of the forum loads a web app — sidebar, trackers, infinite
chrome — around text that deserves better. Long threads about type systems
and macro expanders scroll past in a browser tab you lose the moment you
switch away. And there is no desktop client at all: Discourse ships
official iOS/Android apps, but desktop users get a URL.

Threadly is that desktop client, built the way the Racket community
builds things: a small Racket engine, first-party native UI, and no
magic.

## How it works

- **Browse** — the latest topics across all categories, with reply, view,
  and like counts, backed by a polite on-disk cache so re-opening a view
  never re-hits the forum.
- **Read** — a thread view built for long discussions: posts in reading
  order, rendered from the forum's own HTML, with the author and original
  thread one click away on the web. Long threads load in batches with the
  scroll position intact, forum links inside a post open in the app, and
  locally tracked read state marks topics with posts past your last read.
- **Search** — full archive search, keyboard-first.

The engine speaks the anonymous public Discourse JSON API (any forum URL
plus `.json`). No account, no scraping, no private endpoints.

## Design principles

1. **The forum is the source of truth.** Threadly caches, it never forks:
   edits, deletions, and topic moves always win, and every thread links
   back to the web.
2. **A good citizen.** Public endpoints only, every response cached on
   disk with a TTL, requests carry a identifying User-Agent, and a 429 is
   honored rather than retried into the ground.
3. **Anonymous reading first.** Public reading needs no account. Signed-in
   actions use Discourse's user API key flow; credentials stay local and must
   never appear in caches, logs or feedback.
4. **Long-form first.** The reading experience is the product; chrome is
   the thing being removed.

## Status & roadmap

Working today: the Discourse engine (latest / topic / search / categories),
the TTL disk cache with offline fallback, a terminal CLI, and native hosts
for macOS, Windows and Linux. Signed-in actions and BYOK AI are implemented;
packaged workflow evidence remains a separate delivery gate. The forum has
user API key issuance disabled at the moment, so sign-in actions wait on
the forum's own policy; anonymous reading is unaffected. The 0.15.0
reading features (batched threads, in-app link following, local read
tracking) ship on macOS first; Windows and Linux parity is tracked in
issues #17 and #18.

- [x] M0 — Discourse engine, disk cache, CLI, macOS SwiftUI shell
- [x] M1 — Windows and Linux native hosts
- [x] M2 — signed-in mode: user API key flow, replies, likes (with the
      forum's own like state), notifications, mark-as-read — on all
      three desktop platforms
- [x] M3 — reading value-add: AI thread summaries and translation over
      any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (configurable via the CLI)
- [ ] Mobile is a deferred option, gated on user demand, maintenance capacity
      and Rivet device-delivery evidence; it is not a current commitment.

## AI features (M3)

Summaries and translation run over any OpenAI-compatible
chat-completions endpoint. Configure once from the terminal; every host
and the CLI pick it up:

```bash
racket app/cli.rkt ai-config --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 \
    --api-key sk-... --model gpt-4o-mini --target-lang Chinese
racket app/cli.rkt summary 4416      # AI summary of a thread
racket app/cli.rkt translate 4416    # AI translation of a thread
```

The key is stored 0600 in the data directory and never leaves the
machine except to the configured endpoint. In the desktop apps, open a
thread and use the Summarize / Translate toolbar buttons.

## Install

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/turlamai/threadly/releases/latest).
Assets follow `threadly-<version>-<os>-<arch>.<ext>`:

| Platform | Installers | Portable / in-app update payload |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 14+ (Apple silicon / Intel) | `threadly-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` · `-x64.dmg` | `threadly-<version>-macos-arm64.zip` · `-x64.zip` |
| Windows 10+ x64 | `threadly-<version>-windows-x64.msi` | `threadly-<version>-windows-x64.zip` |
| Linux x64 / arm64 | `threadly-<version>-linux-<arch>.deb` · `.rpm` · `.AppImage` · `.flatpak` (app id `site.jrtx.threadly`; `flatpak --user install ./threadly-<version>-linux-<arch>.flatpak`) | `threadly-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` (the feed payload) · `-linux-<arch>.zip` |

Every release carries a checked `SHA256SUMS`, and the in-app updater
consumes the Ed25519-signed `update-manifest.json` feed (key id
`threadly-2026-10`; Sigstore provenance: `gh attestation verify <file>
-R turlamai/threadly`). The update behavior contract is recorded in
[docs/UPDATE.md](docs/UPDATE.md).

Package signing status: the macOS DMG is ad-hoc signed (Gatekeeper may
warn on first launch — right-click the app and choose Open); the Windows
MSI and zip are unsigned (SmartScreen may warn); the Linux packages
require no paid publisher account. Update metadata itself is always
Ed25519 signed and verified before anything is applied.

## Build from source

```bash
raco test tests/                     # everything must stay green (no network needed)

racket app/cli.rkt latest            # browse from the terminal
racket app/cli.rkt topic <id>        # read a thread
racket app/cli.rkt search "raco"     # search the archive
racket app/cli.rkt doctor            # local environment check (offline)
```

Threadly follows the [Rivet](https://github.com/turlamai/rivet)
architecture: a Racket engine behind first-party native hosts. The macOS
shell lives in `macos-host/` and builds through `raco rivet build`.
